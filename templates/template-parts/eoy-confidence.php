        <h2>Confidence & Agency</h2>
        <div>
            <div>Confidence is necessary to identify, pursue, and achieve one’s professional ambitions. At Digital NEST, we bake confidence into our programming within four categories: career navigation skills, professional skills, technical skills, and (for our 18+ members) securing a next step that prepares them for a wealth-building career such as a job, internship, or enrollment or return to college. </div>
            <div>This year, our members reported dramatic increases in their ability to navigate their futures. When NESTers exercise their agency to follow their dreams, transformation begins.</div>
